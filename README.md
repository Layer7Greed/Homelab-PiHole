# Homelab-PiHole
Set up and manage a personal network-wide ad blocker on a Raspberry Pi to improve network performance, enhance privacy, and gain practical experience with network management and DNS traffic monitoring.

### Skills Learned
- Set up and configured a Raspberry Pi 4 with an **Argon ONE V2 case** for improved cooling and stable operation.  
- Installed **DietPi** as a lightweight alternative to Raspbian for optimal performance.  
- Deployed **Pi-hole** and configured it as the DNS server on the home network/modem.  
- Monitored and analyzed network traffic via the **Pi-hole web interface**.  
- Added and managed custom **ad-blocking lists** to improve browsing experience and network performance.  
- Gained hands-on experience in **network management, DNS configuration, and home lab setup**.

[EDIT NEXT TIME]
- DNS / Ad‑blocking: **Pi‑hole** (FTL / dnsmasq backend, web admin)
- Remote access & management: **SSH** 
- Router/modem configuration (to point network DNS to Pi‑hole)  
- Adlist sources & block‑list management (via Pi‑hole web UI)
